				Hello eveyone! I am Kyle Faure, currently an computer science undergraduate<br>
				at the University of the Western Cape. This project features my understanding <br>
				of HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/PHP and will be used to show my knowledge <br>
				about these languages when applying for potential future Jobs. <br>
				Why would i create a website that focuses on Japan? The answer is simple. Its my <br>
				my dream to one day go to Japan, i find it fitting to remind myself of this dream <br>
				in every possible way. <br>
				Enjoy.
