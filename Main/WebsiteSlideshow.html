						<p>	This famous Alley, also known as <b>"shotengai"</b>, is one of the 
							many found in Tokyo.These alleys are typically in the form of a 
							local market street that is closed to car traffic. Local shotengai 
							cater to the needs of nearby residents with a diverse mix of small 
							specialty shops and few large retailers. In many older neighborhoods, 
							these streets serve as cultural gathering spaces, holding seasonal 
							festivals, processions, and other events throughout the year.

						<p>	Chiba is the capital and largest city of Chiba Prefecture,
							with other major cities including Funabashi, Matsudo, Ichikawa 
							and Kashiwa. Chiba Prefecture is located on Japan's eastern 
							Pacific coast to the east of Tokyo, and is part of the Greater 
							Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world. 
							Chiba Prefecture largely consists of the Boso Peninsula, which 
							encloses the eastern side of Tokyo Bay and separates it from Kanagawa Prefecture.

						<p>	There is more to Japan than just the cities. Although a hard majority 
							of the country lives in urban areas <b>and over 30% of those people are in 
							Tokyo alone!</b>, a lot of those urban areas end up being small cities in the 
							countryside. These are cities of 100,000 to 200,000 people, dense at the 
							core but only several kilometers from rice farms and forested mountains. 
							Going further out from them, you will find small towns and hamlets.
