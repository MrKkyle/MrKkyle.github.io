							These Alleys, also known as <b>"shotengai"</b>, is one of the 
							many found in Japan. These alleys are typically in the form of a 
							local market street that is closed to car traffic. Local shotengai 
							cater to the needs of nearby residents with a diverse mix of small 
							specialty shops and few large retailers. In many older neighborhoods, 
							these streets serve as cultural gathering spaces, holding seasonal 
							festivals, processions, and other events throughout the year.

							Bus is the main way to get around if you're in rural Japan, but even in areas fairly close to Tokyo, 
							some buses only run 2 or 3 times per day, and not at all on weekends.
							In areas closer to a train station, there are usually trains coming into the stations 
							every 30 minutes at semi-rural areas.
							In the countryside, however, the number of trains might just be 2 per day (Once in the early 
							morning, once in the late evening).

							Japan might not be the first country that springs to mind when you think of a beach vacation, but

							beaches, particularly on the dreamy southern islands.
							International surfers speak highly of Japan's lively surf scene, which tends to be very inclusive, giving coastal towns a 
							uniquely Japanese but universally chilled-out surf vibe.

							Chiba is the capital and largest city of Chiba Prefecture,
							with other major cities including Funabashi, Matsudo, Ichikawa 
							and Kashiwa. Chiba Prefecture is located on Japan's eastern 
							Pacific coast to the east of Tokyo, and is part of the Greater 
							Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world. 
							Chiba Prefecture largely consists of the Boso Peninsula, which 
							encloses the eastern side of Tokyo Bay and separates it from Kanagawa Prefecture.

						<div class = "flip-box-back">
							A lot of people interested in coming to Japan think that only city life is good. 
							But in reality, living in the country also has a lot of benefits, such as nature 
							and fresh air. I won't deny that the city can be very convenient and that if you're 
							drawn to the hustle of the city and the bright lights, maybe the countryside is 
							not for you. However, if you're looking for something a little different, let's 
							talk about some of the things you can get from the Japanese countryside that the 
							big cities just can't offer.

							Convenience stores primarily sell food, including a large range of meals, snacks and sweets,

							instant ramen, microwave meals and hot foods like fried chicken, nikuman and oden. 
							Some cold foods, such as onigiri, can be heated in the store.
							The stores also sell all kinds of hot and cold beverages including soda, coffee, tea, 
							water, sport drinks, juice, milk and vitamin drinks. The selection changes frequently 
							and often varies by season as well.

							Sakura
						</div>
						<div class = "flip-box-back">
							Cherry blossoms hold many meanings, the first being that life is fleeting. They are 
							beautiful to see in their prime, but the flowers and the trees are short-lived â€” 
							blooming for only a few weeks before falling to the ground and withering away.
							The sakura's meaning is also contradictory. It symbolizes both life and death, beauty 
							and violence. As the coming of spring promises new life, so the blooming of cherry blossoms 
							brings a sense of vitality and vibrancy. At the same time, their short lifespan is a 
							reminder that life is fleeting.
