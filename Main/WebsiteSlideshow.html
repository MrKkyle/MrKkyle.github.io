							These Alleys, also known as <b>"shotengai"</b>, is one of the 
							many found in Japan. These alleys are typically in the form of a 
							local market street that is closed to car traffic. Local shotengai 
							cater to the needs of nearby residents with a diverse mix of small 
							specialty shops and few large retailers. In many older neighborhoods, 
							these streets serve as cultural gathering spaces, holding seasonal 
							festivals, processions, and other events throughout the year.

							Bus is the main way to get around if you're in rural Japan, but even in areas fairly close to Tokyo, 
							some buses only run 2 or 3 times per day, and not at all on weekends.
							In areas closer to a train station, there are usually trains coming into the stations 
							every 30 minutes at semi-rural areas.
							In the countryside, however, the number of trains might just be 2 per day (Once in the early 
							morning, once in the late evening).

							Japan might not be the first country that springs to mind when you think of a beach vacation, but 
							Japanese travelers know that the coastline of this fascinating archipelago is studded with gorgeous
							beaches, particularly on the dreamy southern islands.
							International surfers speak highly of Japan's lively surf scene, which tends to be very inclusive, giving coastal towns a 
							uniquely Japanese but universally chilled-out surf vibe.

							and Kashiwa. Chiba Prefecture is located on Japan's eastern

							Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world. 
							Chiba Prefecture largely consists of the Boso Peninsula, which 
							encloses the eastern side of Tokyo Bay and separates it from Kanagawa Prefecture.
