							These Alleys, also known as <b>"shotengai"</b>, is one of the 
							many found in Japan. These alleys are typically in the form of a 
							local market street that is closed to car traffic. Local shotengai 
							cater to the needs of nearby residents with a diverse mix of small 
							specialty shops and few large retailers. In many older neighborhoods, 
							these streets serve as cultural gathering spaces, holding seasonal 
							festivals, processions, and other events throughout the year.

							Bus is the main way to get around if you're in rural Japan, but even in areas fairly close to Tokyo, 
							some buses only run 2 or 3 times per day, and not at all on weekends.
							In areas closer to a train station, there are usually trains coming into the stations 
							every 30 minutes at semi-rural areas.
							In the countryside, however, the number of trains might just be 2 per day (Once in the early 
							morning, once in the late evening).
