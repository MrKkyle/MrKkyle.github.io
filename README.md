Hello everyone, I am Kyle Faure.

As an individual, if there is anything I am certain about, it would be my attachment to front-end website development. I recently completed my BSC in Computer Science, and while I am grateful for being granted the opportunity to learn at a tertiary institute, I feel like I should have soaked my brain in more front-end frameworks like Vue.js and Angular.js.

After being introduced to React.js earlier last year, during my final two semesters at university, my love for front-end really blossomed. It's component-based architecture just introduced so many of the things I thought would have been done by looping. But why React.js? Simple: It's the highest-ranked framework used in web applications.

With this said, my learning does not end here; in any free time I have, I find myself somehow doing or researching:

- More react components (and packages with npm) that can be implemented into my projects (like Chart.js and Froala)
- Gathering "inspiration" from well-built websites and breaking them apart into components.
- Some back-end frameworks (like Laravel, which is a PHP Framework)
- Unique CSS/JavaScript effects, which I transform into React.js components.
- Reviewing my previously completed projects and making changes to their styles and components, delivering a sense of growth when looking back on the projects that I completed years ago.

While I still have a lot to learn, I definitely feel like I had a very good starting point, thanks to all the support that I received. Please visit my Github projects and let me know if there is anything that you think I can do better. I really appreciate the feedback.

Lastly, on my Github profile, you might see some of my university projects. These projects are the very foundation of my front-end programming career, and they taught me a lot concerning the format of coding, especially concerning object-oriented programming, functions, and scopes.

Thank you for reading.
